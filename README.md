# Ardumower_PCBs

# Attention PCB is not yet finished!

So i have made some test with the Board and i think it need a redesign. 
Some 3V LED did not burn.
The Place between the RTC and the I2c Socket is too small
The 2x4 Pin Connectors fit not with the Schematic, the Pins have a different order.
The Brushless Adapter Board does not fit properly because the distance is not exact
The Board needs more labelling on the pins
Buzzer did not work


And perhaps some other things that i have not tested yet. 

A small simple circuit board for the Ardumower to lead out all the necessary pins.
The charging board and the power supply for the motors are on a separate board.

Should also fit into small housings.

Use it at your own Risk.
